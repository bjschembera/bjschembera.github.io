I studied computer science and philosophy and hold a diploma degree in computer science (Dipl.-Inf.) and a doctoral degree in engineering (Dr.-Ing.). From 2011-2022, I worked as a research associate at the [High-Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS)](https://www.hlrs.de). In 2022, I joined the [Institute of Applied Analysis and Numerical Simulation (IANS)](https://www.ians.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/Schembera-00001/) at the University of Stuttgart, where I work in research data management for mathematical research data within the [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/) project [MaRDI](https://www.mardi4nfdi.de/about/mission).

In 2019, I completed doctoral studies in which I developed strategies for defining and managing [dark data](https://www.hlrs.de/news/detail-view/2020-04-27/) that accumulates at high-performance computing centers. I work in the fields of data infrastructures, metadata, ontologies and metadata extraction. In addition, I am engaged with issues related to the interaction between information technology and society.

My scientific profile is characterized by applied interdisciplinary research with a strong theoretical and analytical background. In addition to (i) distributed and information systems as a core area of computer science, my scientific interests include (ii) research data management. In this context, I work on data infrastructures, ontologies, metadata standards, and metadata extraction. This research is framed by the notion of (iii) dark data. In addition, I work in the area of (iv) computer science and society and (v) philosophy of computer simulation. My academic profile is complemented by work experience in the design, implementation and operation of complex distributed data storage systems in the petabyte class as well as strong Unix, Linux and programming skills.
